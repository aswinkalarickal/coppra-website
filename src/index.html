                    Coppra was a collaboration between a group of youngsters aimed at producing high quality games and apps. 
                    We had the privilege of working with clients such as <a href="https://sv.co/">Startup Village</a>, <a href="http://www.kseb.in/">KSEB</a> and <a href="http://beaumondefernhotel.com/">Beaumonde</a>. 
                    Weâ€™ve since left to follow other opportunities, but feel free to drop us a mail at <a href="mailto:hello@coppra.in">hello@coppra.in</a>
